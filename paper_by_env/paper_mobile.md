The system combines verbal instructions, user demonstrations, and app UI hierarchies to generalize scripts from single demonstrations, facilitating task variations and parameterization. Extensive error handling and context checking enhance robustness against app UI changes. A lab study indicates that users with minimal programming knowledge can successfully automate smartphone tasks using SUGILITE.
