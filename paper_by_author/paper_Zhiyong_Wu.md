    - 💻 Env: [GUI]
    - 🔑 Key: [model], [reinforcement learning], [UI‑TARS‑2]
    - 📖 TLDR: UI‑TARS‑2 is a newly trained native GUI‑centered agent that uses a scalable data flywheel, stabilized multi‑turn reinforcement learning, hybrid GUI + terminal environments, and a unified sandbox. It achieves leading performance across diverse GUI benchmarks (e.g., 88.2 on Online‑Mind2Web), game tasks (~60% human-level), and generalizes to information-seeking and software engineering tasks. Training dynamics and parameter interpolation offer insights into robust, efficient agent RL at scale.

    - 🔑 Key: [framework], [dataset], [neural-symbolic self-training], [online exploration], [self-refinement]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces *ENVISIONS*, a neural-symbolic self-training framework designed to improve large language models (LLMs) by enabling self-training through interaction with a symbolic environment. The framework addresses symbolic data scarcity and enhances LLMs' symbolic reasoning proficiency by iteratively exploring, refining, and learning from symbolic tasks without reinforcement learning. Extensive evaluations across web navigation, math, and logical reasoning tasks highlight *ENVISIONS* as a promising approach for enhancing LLM symbolic processing.
