    - 💻 Env: [Web]
    - 🔑 Key: [benchmark], [agentic search], [Agent-as-a-Judge], [evaluation], [Mind2Web 2]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces **Mind2Web 2**, a benchmark of 130 long-horizon, real-world tasks requiring web browsing and extensive information synthesis. It proposes an **Agent-as-a-Judge** framework to automatically and rigorously evaluate the correctness and source attribution of answers for agentic search systems. Through a detailed evaluation of nine frontier systems, the paper highlights OpenAI’s Deep Research system as the best performer, achieving 50-70% of human performance while reducing time consumption by half. Mind2Web 2 offers a foundation for benchmarking next-generation agentic search systems.

    - 💻 Env: [Web]
    - 🔑 Key: [benchmark], [evaluation], [Online-Mind2Web], [WebJudge], [Operator], [LLM-as-a-Judge]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper critically evaluates the performance of current web agents, revealing that many underperform on the newly introduced **Online-Mind2Web** benchmark, which comprises 300 realistic tasks across 136 websites. The study highlights a discrepancy between reported successes and actual capabilities, attributing this to shortcomings in existing benchmarks. To address evaluation scalability, the authors propose **WebJudge**, an automatic LLM-based evaluation method achieving approximately 85% agreement with human judgments. The comprehensive analysis underscores the need for more robust assessment frameworks in web agent research.

    - 📖 TLDR: This paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can function as world models within web environments, enabling model-based planning for web agents. Introducing **WebDreamer**, a framework that leverages LLMs to simulate potential action sequences in web environments, the study demonstrates significant performance improvements over reactive baselines on benchmarks like VisualWebArena and Mind2Web-live. The findings suggest that LLMs possess the capability to model the dynamic nature of the internet, paving the way for advancements in automated web interaction and opening new research avenues in optimizing LLMs for complex, evolving environments.

- [Navigating the Digital World as Humans Do: Universal Visual Grounding for GUI Agents](https://proceedings.iclr.cc/paper_files/paper/2025/hash/0faa4bc5f522076947a030273629d4fe-Abstract-Conference.html)

    - 💻 Env: [GUI]
    - 🔑 Key: [model], [dataset], [visual grounding], [GUI agent], [cross-platform generalization], [UGround], [SeeAct-V], [synthetic data]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces UGround, a universal visual grounding model for GUI agents that enables human-like navigation of digital interfaces. The authors advocate for GUI agents with human-like embodiment that perceive the environment entirely visually and take pixel-level actions. UGround is trained on a large-scale synthetic dataset of 10M GUI elements across 1.3M screenshots. Evaluated on six benchmarks spanning grounding, offline, and online agent tasks, UGround significantly outperforms existing visual grounding models by up to 20% absolute. Agents using UGround achieve comparable or better performance than state-of-the-art agents that rely on additional textual input, demonstrating the feasibility of vision-only GUI agents.

    - 📑 Publisher: ICML 2024
    - 💻 Env: [Web]
    - 🔑 Key: [framework], [dataset], [benchmark], [grounding], [SeeAct], [Multimodal-Mind2web]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper explores the capability of GPT-4V(ision), a multimodal model, as a web agent that can perform tasks across various websites by following natural language instructions. It introduces the **SEEACT** framework, enabling GPT-4V to navigate, interpret, and interact with elements on websites. Evaluated using the **Mind2Web** benchmark and an online test environment, the framework demonstrates high performance on complex web tasks by integrating grounding strategies like element attributes and image annotations to improve HTML element targeting. However, grounding remains challenging, presenting opportunities for further improvement.
