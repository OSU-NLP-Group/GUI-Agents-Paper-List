    - 🔑 Key: [dataset], [safety]
    - 📖 TLDR:  Autonomous web agents powered by LLMs can take unintended or harmful actions when interacting with websites (especially state-changing ones). WebGuard is introduced as a dataset to assess risks of web agent actions by collecting nearly 5,000 human‑annotated actions across many real websites, labeled by risk level (SAFE / LOW / HIGH). Baseline LLMs do poorly (<60% accuracy / recall) on detecting high‑risk actions; after fine‑tuning (using Qwen2.5VL‑7B), performance improves significantly (accuracy ~80%, recall on HIGH ~76%), though still not sufficient for very high‑stakes settings. The paper highlights that reliable guardrails for web agents remain an open challenge. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces UGround, a universal visual grounding model for GUI agents that enables human-like navigation of digital interfaces. The authors advocate for GUI agents with human-like embodiment that perceive the environment entirely visually and take pixel-level actions. UGround is trained on a large-scale synthetic dataset of 10M GUI elements across 1.3M screenshots. Evaluated on six benchmarks spanning grounding, offline, and online agent tasks, UGround significantly outperforms existing visual grounding models by up to 20% absolute. Agents using UGround achieve comparable or better performance than state-of-the-art agents that rely on additional textual input, demonstrating the feasibility of vision-only GUI agents.
