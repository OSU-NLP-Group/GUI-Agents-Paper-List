    - 🔑 Key: [benchmark], [dataset], [framework], [long-horizon reasoning], [unknown-tools challenge], [execution-based evaluation], [MCP-Universe]
    - 📖 TLDR: MCP-Universe introduces the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) through interactions with real-world Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. It spans six core domains—Location Navigation, Repository Management, Financial Analysis, 3D Design, Browser Automation, and Web Searching—across 11 MCP servers. The benchmark employs execution-based evaluators (format, static, dynamic) to rigorously assess agent performance. Despite progress, state-of-the-art models like GPT-5 (43.72% success), Grok-4 (33.33%), and Claude-4.0-Sonnet (29.44%) show significant limitations. The benchmark highlights challenges in long-context reasoning and unfamiliar tool handling, and provides an open-source extensible evaluation framework with UI support to accelerate future research.

    - 📖 TLDR: This paper tackles two major challenges in GUI agents — planning ambiguity and visual grounding accuracy. It introduces **GTA1**, a GUI Test-time Scaling Agent that improves action decision-making by sampling multiple candidate actions at each step and selecting the best one via a judge model. Additionally, it enhances grounding through reinforcement learning with success-based rewards. GTA1 achieves state-of-the-art results on GUI grounding and execution benchmarks such as ScreenSpot and OSWorld.

    - 🔑 Key: [model], [dataset], [planning], [reasoning], [Aguvis], [visual grounding]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces *Aguvis*, a unified pure vision-based framework for autonomous GUI agents that operates across various platforms. It leverages image-based observations and grounds natural language instructions to visual elements, employing a consistent action space to ensure cross-platform generalization. The approach integrates explicit planning and reasoning within the model, enhancing its ability to autonomously navigate and interact with complex digital environments. A large-scale dataset of GUI agent trajectories is constructed, incorporating multimodal reasoning and grounding. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Aguvis surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in both offline and real-world online scenarios, achieving the first fully autonomous pure vision GUI agent capable of performing tasks independently without collaboration with external closed-source models. All datasets, models, and training recipes are open-sourced to facilitate future research.
