    - 📖 TLDR: This paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can function as world models within web environments, enabling model-based planning for web agents. Introducing **WebDreamer**, a framework that leverages LLMs to simulate potential action sequences in web environments, the study demonstrates significant performance improvements over reactive baselines on benchmarks like VisualWebArena and Mind2Web-live. The findings suggest that LLMs possess the capability to model the dynamic nature of the internet, paving the way for advancements in automated web interaction and opening new research avenues in optimizing LLMs for complex, evolving environments.

    - 🔑 Key: [safety], [black-box attack], [adversarial prompter model], [Direct Policy Optimization]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper presents AdvWeb, a black-box attack framework that exploits vulnerabilities in vision-language model (VLM)-powered web agents by injecting adversarial prompts directly into web pages. Using Direct Policy Optimization (DPO), AdvWeb trains an adversarial prompter model that can mislead agents into executing harmful actions, such as unauthorized financial transactions, while maintaining high stealth and control. Extensive evaluations reveal that AdvWeb achieves high success rates across multiple real-world tasks, emphasizing the need for stronger security measures in web agent deployments.

    - 💻 Env: [Web]
    - 🔑 Key: [safety], [privacy attack], [environmental injection], [stealth attack]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces the Environmental Injection Attack (EIA), a privacy attack targeting generalist web agents by embedding malicious yet concealed web elements to trick agents into leaking users' PII. Utilizing 177 action steps within realistic web scenarios, EIA demonstrates a high success rate in extracting specific PII and whole user requests. Through its detailed threat model and defense suggestions, the work underscores the challenge of detecting and mitigating privacy risks in autonomous web agents.

    - 💻 Env: [Misc]
    - 🔑 Key: [safety], [adversarial attacks], [security risks], [language agents], [Perception-Brain-Action]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces a conceptual framework to assess and understand adversarial vulnerabilities in language agents, dividing the agent structure into three components—Perception, Brain, and Action. It discusses 12 specific adversarial attack types that exploit these components, ranging from input manipulation to complex backdoor and jailbreak attacks. The framework provides a basis for identifying and mitigating risks before the widespread deployment of these agents in real-world applications.
