    - 🏛️ Institutions: Xi'an Jiaotong University, Shanghai AI Lab, HKU, Nanjing University
    - 📅 Date: November 2023
    - 📑 Publisher: arXiv
    - 💻 Env: [GUI (evaluated on web, math reasoning, and logic reasoning environments)]
    - 🔑 Key: [framework], [dataset], [neural-symbolic self-training], [online exploration], [self-refinement]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces *ENVISIONS*, a neural-symbolic self-training framework designed to improve large language models (LLMs) by enabling self-training through interaction with a symbolic environment. The framework addresses symbolic data scarcity and enhances LLMs' symbolic reasoning proficiency by iteratively exploring, refining, and learning from symbolic tasks without reinforcement learning. Extensive evaluations across web navigation, math, and logical reasoning tasks highlight *ENVISIONS* as a promising approach for enhancing LLM symbolic processing.
