    - 💻 Env: [desktop]
    - 🔑 Key: [framework], [knowledge-execution gap], [Critique Stage], [Retrace Stage], [OSWorld], [self‑evolution]
    - 📖 TLDR: The paper identifies a “knowledge‑execution gap” where even highly accurate external knowledge (90%) only yields a 41% execution success rate. To bridge this, the authors introduce **UI‑Evol**, a plug‑and‑play two‑stage module for GUI agents—**Retrace** recovers actual action sequences from real agent–environment interactions, and **Critique** refines knowledge by comparing these sequences with external references. Experiments using Agent S2 on the OSWorld benchmark show significant gains in task performance and reduced behavioral variance, improving agent reliability.

    - 🔑 Key: [framework], [reinforcement learning], [subgoal generation], [VSC-RL], [learning efficiency]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces **VSC-RL**, a novel reinforcement learning framework that enhances learning efficiency for vision-language agents in complex sequential decision-making tasks. By reformulating these tasks as variational goal-conditioned problems, VSC-RL leverages advanced optimization techniques and utilizes vision-language models to autonomously decompose goals into feasible subgoals. Empirical results demonstrate that VSC-RL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art agents, particularly in challenging mobile device control tasks.

    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces **DistRL**, a novel framework designed to enhance the efficiency of online reinforcement learning fine-tuning for mobile device control agents. DistRL employs centralized training and decentralized data acquisition to ensure efficient fine-tuning in dynamic online interactions. The framework is supported by a custom RL algorithm, A-RIDE, which balances exploration with prioritized data utilization to ensure stable and robust training. Experiments demonstrate that DistRL improves training efficiency by 3× and accelerates data collection by 2.4× compared to leading synchronous multi-machine methods. Notably, after training, DistRL achieves a 20% relative improvement in success rate on general Android tasks from an open benchmark, outperforming existing approaches while maintaining the same training time.
