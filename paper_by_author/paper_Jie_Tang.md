    - 💻 Env: [GUI]
    - 🔑 Key: [model], [reinforcement learning], [UI-TARS-2]
    - 📖 TLDR: UI‑TARS‑2 is a newly trained native GUI‑centered agent that uses a scalable data flywheel, stabilized multi‑turn reinforcement learning, hybrid GUI + terminal environments, and a unified sandbox. It achieves leading performance across diverse GUI benchmarks (e.g., 88.2 on Online‑Mind2Web), game tasks (~60% human-level), and generalizes to information-seeking and software engineering tasks. Training dynamics and parameter interpolation offer insights into robust, efficient agent RL at scale.

    - 🔑 Key: [framework], [model], [benchmark], [API-GUI paradigm], [dataset], [distributed RL], [entropulse]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper presents **ComputerRL**, a large-scale end-to-end reinforcement learning framework enabling agents to operate complex desktop tasks. It introduces the **API-GUI paradigm**, combining programmatic API calls with GUI actions, and a **distributed RL infrastructure** managing thousands of parallel virtual Ubuntu desktops for scalable training. A novel **Entropulse** training strategy alternates between reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning to prevent entropy collapse over long training runs. Applied to open models like GLM-4-9B-0414, ComputerRL achieves a new state-of-the-art success rate of **48.9%** on the OSWorld benchmark via the GLM-ComputerRL-9B model.
