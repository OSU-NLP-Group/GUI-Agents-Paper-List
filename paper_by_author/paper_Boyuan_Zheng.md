    - 💻 Env: [Web]
    - 🔑 Key: [framework], [WebDreamer], [model-based planning], [world model]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can function as world models within web environments, enabling model-based planning for web agents. Introducing **WebDreamer**, a framework that leverages LLMs to simulate potential action sequences in web environments, the study demonstrates significant performance improvements over reactive baselines on benchmarks like VisualWebArena and Mind2Web-live. The findings suggest that LLMs possess the capability to model the dynamic nature of the internet, paving the way for advancements in automated web interaction and opening new research avenues in optimizing LLMs for complex, evolving environments.

- [Navigating the Digital World as Humans Do: Universal Visual Grounding for GUI Agents](https://osu-nlp-group.github.io/UGround/)

    - 💻 Env: [GUI]
    - 🔑 Key: [framework], [model], [dataset], [visual grounding], [GUI agents], [cross-platform generalization], [UGround], [SeeAct-V], [synthetic data]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces UGround, a universal visual grounding model for GUI agents that enables human-like navigation of digital interfaces. The authors advocate for GUI agents with human-like embodiment that perceive the environment entirely visually and take pixel-level actions. UGround is trained on a large-scale synthetic dataset of 10M GUI elements across 1.3M screenshots. Evaluated on six benchmarks spanning grounding, offline, and online agent tasks, UGround significantly outperforms existing visual grounding models by up to 20% absolute. Agents using UGround achieve comparable or better performance than state-of-the-art agents that rely on additional textual input, demonstrating the feasibility of vision-only GUI agents.

- [A Trembling House of Cards? Mapping Adversarial Attacks against Language Agents](https://www.catalyzex.com/paper/a-trembling-house-of-cards-mapping)

    - 📅 Date: February 15, 2024
    - 📑 Publisher: arXiv
    - 💻 Env: [Misc]
    - 🔑 Key: [safety], [adversarial attacks], [security risks], [language agents], [Perception-Brain-Action]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces a conceptual framework to assess and understand adversarial vulnerabilities in language agents, dividing the agent structure into three components—Perception, Brain, and Action. It discusses 12 specific adversarial attack types that exploit these components, ranging from input manipulation to complex backdoor and jailbreak attacks. The framework provides a basis for identifying and mitigating risks before the widespread deployment of these agents in real-world applications.

- [Dual-View Visual Contextualization for Web Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04476)
    - Jihyung Kil, Chan Hee Song, Boyuan Zheng, Xiang Deng, Yu Su, Wei-Lun Chao
    - 🏛️ Institutions: OSU
    - 📅 Date: February 6, 2024
    - 📑 Publisher: CVPR 2024
    - 💻 Env: [Web]
    - 🔑 Key: [framework], [visual contextualization]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper proposes a novel approach to web navigation by contextualizing HTML elements through their "dual views" in webpage screenshots. The method leverages both the textual content of HTML elements and their visual representation in the screenshot to create more informative representations for web agents. Evaluated on the Mind2Web dataset, the approach demonstrates consistent improvements over baseline methods across various scenarios, including cross-task, cross-website, and cross-domain navigation tasks.

- [GPT-4V(ision) is a Generalist Web Agent, if Grounded](https://osu-nlp-group.github.io/SeeAct/)

    - 💻 Env: [Web]
    - 🔑 Key: [framework], [dataset], [benchmark], [grounding], [SeeAct], [Multimodal-Mind2web]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper explores the capability of GPT-4V(ision), a multimodal model, as a web agent that can perform tasks across various websites by following natural language instructions. It introduces the **SEEACT** framework, enabling GPT-4V to navigate, interpret, and interact with elements on websites. Evaluated using the **Mind2Web** benchmark and an online test environment, the framework demonstrates high performance on complex web tasks by integrating grounding strategies like element attributes and image annotations to improve HTML element targeting. However, grounding remains challenging, presenting opportunities for further improvement.

    - 📖 TLDR: *Mind2Web* presents a dataset and benchmark specifically crafted for generalist web agents capable of performing language-guided tasks across varied websites. Featuring over 2,000 tasks from 137 sites, it spans 31 domains and emphasizes open-ended, realistic tasks in authentic, unsimplified web settings. The study proposes the *MindAct* framework, which optimizes LLMs for handling complex HTML elements by using small LMs to rank elements before full processing, thereby enhancing the efficiency and versatility of web agents in diverse contexts.
