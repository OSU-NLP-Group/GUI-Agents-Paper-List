    - 🔑 Key: [framework], [dataset], [benchmark], [chain-of-thought], [vision language model], [AgentNet]
    - 📖 TLDR: Introduces **OpenCUA**, an open-source framework to train computer-use agents (CUAs) using vision-language models. It includes a cross-platform annotation tool (AgentNet Tool), a large-scale dataset covering 3 OSes and 200+ apps/websites (AgentNet), and a data processing pipeline that builds state-action pairs enhanced with reflective long chain-of-thought reasoning. The resulting models—especially OpenCUA-72B—achieve SOTA performance on the OSWorld-Verified benchmark (45.0% success), surpassing prior open-source baselines and demonstrating strong generalization and scalability. All tools, models, and data are publicly released.

    - 💻 Env: [Web]
    - 🔑 Key: [dataset], [benchmark], [safety], [guardrail], [WebGuard]
    - 📖 TLDR: Autonomous web agents powered by LLMs can take unintended or harmful actions when interacting with websites (especially state-changing ones). WebGuard is introduced as a dataset to assess risks of web agent actions by collecting nearly 5,000 human‑annotated actions across many real websites, labeled by risk level (SAFE / LOW / HIGH). Baseline LLMs do poorly (<60% accuracy / recall) on detecting high‑risk actions; after fine‑tuning (using Qwen2.5VL‑7B), performance improves significantly (accuracy ~80%, recall on HIGH ~76%), though still not sufficient for very high‑stakes settings. The paper highlights that reliable guardrails for web agents remain an open challenge.

    - 🔑 Key: [model], [dataset], [visual grounding], [GUI agent], [cross-platform generalization], [UGround], [SeeAct-v], [synthetic data]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces UGround, a universal visual grounding model for GUI agents that enables human-like navigation of digital interfaces. The authors advocate for GUI agents with human-like embodiment that perceive the environment entirely visually and take pixel-level actions. UGround is trained on a large-scale synthetic dataset of 10M GUI elements across 1.3M screenshots. Evaluated on six benchmarks spanning grounding, offline, and online agent tasks, UGround significantly outperforms existing visual grounding models by up to 20% absolute. Agents using UGround achieve comparable or better performance than state-of-the-art agents that rely on additional textual input, demonstrating the feasibility of vision-only GUI agents.

    - 💻 Env: [Web]
    - 🔑 Key: [framework], [visual contextualization]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper proposes a novel approach to web navigation by contextualizing HTML elements through their "dual views" in webpage screenshots. The method leverages both the textual content of HTML elements and their visual representation in the screenshot to create more informative representations for web agents. Evaluated on the Mind2Web dataset, the approach demonstrates consistent improvements over baseline methods across various scenarios, including cross-task, cross-website, and cross-domain navigation tasks.
