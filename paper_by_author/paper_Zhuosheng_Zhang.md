    - 🔑 Key: [evaluation framework], [Ground-Truth Alignment], [reasoning-execution gap], [chain-of-thought], [VLM]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper investigates reasoning-execution mismatches in VLM-powered mobile agents, revealing that models often generate correct reasoning but fail in execution. It introduces an evaluation framework combining execution accuracy and a new metric called Ground-Truth Alignment (GTA). The authors identify two types of errors—Execution Gap and Reasoning Gap—and show that model scaling alleviates but does not resolve these issues.

    - 📖 TLDR: Introduces **XBOUND**, a novel evaluation framework assessing device-control (DC) agents at a fine-grained level by constructing "trajectory trees" from Android GUI interaction traces. The method defines an **Explore Metric**, measuring how well agents generalize across branching states and actions. A large-scale pseudo trajectory-tree dataset (~1,536 episodes, 43,759 instructions) was built using GPT4o-mini and Qwen2.5-vl. The study benchmarks OS‑Atlas and UI‑TARS agents across width/depth dimensions, revealing state and action comprehension gaps. It offers actionable insights into DC agent limitations and proposes directions for improving GUI-based agent capabilities.

    - 🔑 Key: [framework], [dynamic planning], [D-PoT], [mobile agent]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces a novel method called Dynamic Planning of Thoughts (D-PoT) aimed at enhancing LLM-based agents for GUI tasks. It addresses the challenges of task execution by dynamically adjusting planning based on environmental feedback and action history, outperforming existing methods such as ReAct by improving accuracy significantly in navigating GUI environments. The study emphasizes the importance of integrating execution history and contextual cues to optimize decision-making processes for autonomous agents.

    - 🔑 Key: [safety], [robustness], [environmental distraction], [multimodal LLM agent]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper highlights the vulnerability of multimodal agents to environmental distractions. The researchers demonstrate that these agents, which process multiple types of input (e.g., text, images, audio), can be significantly impacted by irrelevant or misleading environmental cues. The study provides insights into the limitations of current multimodal systems and emphasizes the need for more robust architectures that can filter out distractions and maintain focus on relevant information in complex, real-world environments.
