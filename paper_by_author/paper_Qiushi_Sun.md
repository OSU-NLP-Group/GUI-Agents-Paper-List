    - 💻 Env: [GUI]
    - 🔑 Key: [framework], [dataset], [benchmark], [mid-training], [reasoning], [GUIMid]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces a mid-training approach to enhance GUI agents by leveraging diverse, reasoning-intensive datasets such as mathematical and coding tasks. The authors demonstrate that training Vision Language Models (VLMs) on these data-rich tasks before fine-tuning on limited GUI trajectory data significantly improves performance on GUI benchmarks like WebArena and AndroidWorld. Notably, text-only mathematical reasoning data led to substantial cross-modal gains, highlighting the effectiveness of task generalization in overcoming data scarcity challenges in GUI agent development.

    - 💻 Env: [GUI (evaluated on web, math reasoning, and logic reasoning environments)]
    - 🔑 Key: [framework], [dataset], [neural-symbolic self-training], [online exploration], [self-refinement]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces *ENVISIONS*, a neural-symbolic self-training framework designed to improve large language models (LLMs) by enabling self-training through interaction with a symbolic environment. The framework addresses symbolic data scarcity and enhances LLMs' symbolic reasoning proficiency by iteratively exploring, refining, and learning from symbolic tasks without reinforcement learning. Extensive evaluations across web navigation, math, and logical reasoning tasks highlight *ENVISIONS* as a promising approach for enhancing LLM symbolic processing.
