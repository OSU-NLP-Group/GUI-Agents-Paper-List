    - 🔑 Key: [framework], [dataset], [GUI grounding], [instruction refinement], [adaptive zoom], [AdaZoom-GUI]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper proposes AdaZoom-GUI, a GUI grounding framework that improves both instruction understanding and fine-grained localization on high-resolution interface screenshots. It combines an instruction refinement module with a conditional second-stage zoom-in strategy, and trains the grounding model with GRPO on a newly constructed GUI grounding dataset. The method reports state-of-the-art results among comparable model sizes and is positioned as a practical improvement for robust GUI agent deployment.

    - 🔑 Key: [framework], [continual learning], [reinforcement learning], [GUI grounding], [domain shift], [GUI-AiF], [Continual GUI Agents]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces Continual GUI Agents as a continual learning setting where GUI agents must adapt to domain and resolution shifts over time without losing stable grounding. It proposes GUI-AiF, a reinforcement fine-tuning framework with anchoring-point and anchoring-region rewards that keep agents aligned to changing interaction targets instead of overfitting to static cues. Experiments show the method outperforms prior baselines and frames continual adaptation as a core systems challenge for GUI agents.

    - 💻 Env: [GUI]
    - 🔑 Key: [framework], [reinforcement learning], [GUI grounding], [tool-augmented perception], [active perception], [GUI-Eyes]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper proposes GUI-Eyes, a reinforcement learning framework for active visual perception in GUI grounding. Instead of relying on a single static observation, the agent learns when and how to invoke tools such as cropping and zooming through a two-stage perception policy, supported by a spatially continuous reward tailored to tool usage. With only 3k labeled samples, GUI-Eyes-3B substantially improves grounding accuracy on ScreenSpot-Pro, highlighting the value of tool-aware perception for robust GUI agents.

    - 💻 Env: [GUI]
    - 🔑 Key: [test‑time scaling], [reinforcement learning], [self‑supervised], [GUI‑RC], [GUI‑RCPO], [benchmark], [Region Consistency], [GUI grounding]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces **GUI‑RC (Region Consistency)**, a test-time method that aggregates multiple model predictions via spatial voting to derive a consensus region—achieving 2–3% accuracy improvements on ScreenSpot benchmarks without any additional training. It extends this idea with **GUI‑RCPO (Region Consistency Policy Optimization)**, which turns region-consistency patterns into self-supervised rewards for reinforcement learning at inference time, refining model predictions on unlabeled data and yielding further improvements (e.g., from 83.57% to 85.14% on ScreenSpot‑v2). The approach demonstrates a novel and effective use of test-time optimization for more robust, data-efficient GUI grounding.

    - 🔑 Key: [dataset], [benchmark], [framework], [Jedi], [OSWorld‑G], [GUI grounding], [compositional generalization], [fine‑grained manipulation]
    - 📖 TLDR: This work tackles limitations in GUI grounding by introducing **OSWorld‑G**, a 564‑sample benchmark covering text matching, element recognition, layout understanding, fine‑grained manipulation, and refusal detection. They also synthesize **Jedi**, a massive 4 M‑example dataset generated via UI decomposition and synthesis. Training multi‑scale models on Jedi achieves state‑of‑the‑art grounding across benchmarks (ScreenSpot‑v2/Pro and OSWorld‑G), boosting agentic task performance from 5 % to ~27 % success. Ablations demonstrate compositional benefits. All artifacts are publicly released.
