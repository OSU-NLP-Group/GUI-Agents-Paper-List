    - 💻 Env: [Web]
    - 🔑 Key: [benchmark], [dataset], [multi-turn dialogue], [memory utilization], [self-reflective planning]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper explores multi-turn conversational web navigation, introducing the MT-Mind2Web dataset to support instruction-following tasks for web agents. The proposed Self-MAP (Self-Reflective Memory-Augmented Planning) framework enhances agent performance by integrating memory with self-reflection for sequential decision-making in complex interactions. Extensive evaluations using MT-Mind2Web demonstrate Self-MAP's efficacy in addressing the limitations of current models in multi-turn interactions, providing a novel dataset and framework for evaluating and training agents on detailed, multi-step web-based tasks.
