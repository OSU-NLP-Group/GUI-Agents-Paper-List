    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces *WebChoreArena*, a new fully reproducible benchmark comprising 532 carefully curated tasks designed to extend the scope of WebArena beyond general browsing to more labor-intensive and tedious tasks. WebChoreArena systematically integrates three key challenges: (i) Massive Memory tasks requiring accurate retrieval of large amounts of information in the observations, (ii) Calculation tasks demanding precise mathematical reasoning, and (iii) Long-Term Memory tasks necessitating long-term memory across multiple webpages. Our experiments indicate that even with Gemini 2.5 Pro, there remains substantial room for improvement compared to WebArena, highlighting the increased challenges posed by WebChoreArena.
