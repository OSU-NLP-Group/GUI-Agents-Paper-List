    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces *ScienceBoard*, a dynamic multimodal environment for evaluating autonomous agents in realistic scientific workflows. Built on an Ubuntu-based VM with integrated scientific software supporting both GUI and CLI interactions, the environment enables agents to operate like human researchers. Based on this infrastructure, ScienceBoard curates a benchmark of 169 human-validated tasks spanning six domains, including biochemistry, astronomy, GIS, and theorem proving. Evaluations of both general-purpose LLMs and GUI action models show that even state-of-the-art agents achieve only ~15% success, highlighting the substantial gap between current agent capabilities and real-world scientific demands.

    - 💻 Env: [GUI]
    - 🔑 Key: [benchmark], [robustness], [adversarial attacks], [UGround], [ScreenSpot-V2]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper systematically evaluates the robustness of GUI grounding models, such as UGround, against natural noise, untargeted adversarial attacks, and targeted adversarial attacks. Experiments conducted across mobile, desktop, and web interfaces reveal that these models are highly sensitive to adversarial perturbations and low-resolution conditions. The findings highlight vulnerabilities in current GUI grounding models and establish a benchmark for future research aimed at enhancing their robustness in practical applications.

    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces UGround, a universal visual grounding model for GUI agents that enables human-like navigation of digital interfaces. The authors advocate for GUI agents with human-like embodiment that perceive the environment entirely visually and take pixel-level actions. UGround is trained on a large-scale synthetic dataset of 10M GUI elements across 1.3M screenshots. Evaluated on six benchmarks spanning grounding, offline, and online agent tasks, UGround significantly outperforms existing visual grounding models by up to 20% absolute. Agents using UGround achieve comparable or better performance than state-of-the-art agents that rely on additional textual input, demonstrating the feasibility of vision-only GUI agents.
