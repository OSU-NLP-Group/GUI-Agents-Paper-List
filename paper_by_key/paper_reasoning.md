    - 🔑 Key: [model], [dataset], [planning], [reasoning], [Aguvis], [visual grounding]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces *Aguvis*, a unified pure vision-based framework for autonomous GUI agents that operates across various platforms. It leverages image-based observations and grounds natural language instructions to visual elements, employing a consistent action space to ensure cross-platform generalization. The approach integrates explicit planning and reasoning within the model, enhancing its ability to autonomously navigate and interact with complex digital environments. A large-scale dataset of GUI agent trajectories is constructed, incorporating multimodal reasoning and grounding. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Aguvis surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in both offline and real-world online scenarios, achieving the first fully autonomous pure vision GUI agent capable of performing tasks independently without collaboration with external closed-source models. All datasets, models, and training recipes are open-sourced to facilitate future research.
