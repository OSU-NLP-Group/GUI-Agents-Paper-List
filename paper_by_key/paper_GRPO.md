    - 📖 TLDR: The paper introduces **Location Preference Optimization (LPO)** to improve GUI agent interaction accuracy. It uses information-entropy-driven zones of interest and a dynamic distance-based reward function. Built atop Group Relative Preference Optimization (GRPO), it enables more precise spatial grounding. Results show SOTA performance on offline benchmarks and real-world online GUI tasks.

    - 💻 Env: [Mobile]
    - 🔑 Key: [framework], [dataset], [reinforcement learning], [UI-R1-3B], [GRPO], [AndroidControl], [ScreenSpot-Pro]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces **UI-R1**, a framework that enhances the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for GUI action prediction tasks through rule-based reinforcement learning. Utilizing a small, high-quality dataset of 136 challenging mobile tasks, the authors design a unified rule-based action reward function and optimize the model using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). The resulting model, **UI-R1-3B**, demonstrates significant improvements over the base model (Qwen2.5-VL-3B) on both in-domain (AndroidControl) and out-of-domain (ScreenSpot-Pro) benchmarks, showcasing the effectiveness of rule-based RL in advancing GUI understanding and control.
