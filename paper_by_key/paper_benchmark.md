    - 🔑 Key: [benchmark], [dataset], [framework], [long-horizon reasoning], [unknown-tools challenge], [execution-based evaluation], [MCP-Universe]
    - 📖 TLDR: MCP-Universe introduces the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) through interactions with real-world Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. It spans six core domains—Location Navigation, Repository Management, Financial Analysis, 3D Design, Browser Automation, and Web Searching—across 11 MCP servers. The benchmark employs execution-based evaluators (format, static, dynamic) to rigorously assess agent performance. Despite progress, state-of-the-art models like GPT-5 (43.72% success), Grok-4 (33.33%), and Claude-4.0-Sonnet (29.44%) show significant limitations. The benchmark highlights challenges in long-context reasoning and unfamiliar tool handling, and provides an open-source extensible evaluation framework with UI support to accelerate future research.

    - 🔑 Key: [test‑time scaling], [reinforcement learning], [self‑supervised], [GUI‑RC], [GUI‑RCPO], [benchmark], [Region Consistency], [GUI grounding]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces **GUI‑RC (Region Consistency)**, a test-time method that aggregates multiple model predictions via spatial voting to derive a consensus region—achieving 2–3% accuracy improvements on ScreenSpot benchmarks without any additional training. It extends this idea with **GUI‑RCPO (Region Consistency Policy Optimization)**, which turns region-consistency patterns into self-supervised rewards for reinforcement learning at inference time, refining model predictions on unlabeled data and yielding further improvements (e.g., from 83.57% to 85.14% on ScreenSpot‑v2). The approach demonstrates a novel and effective use of test-time optimization for more robust, data-efficient GUI grounding.

    - 📖 TLDR: The paper introduces **Chain-of-Agents (CoA)**, a novel paradigm enabling a single large language model (LLM) to perform multi-agent style reasoning by dynamically activating tool and role agents within one end-to-end model. They train **Agent Foundation Models (AFMs)** using a two-step approach: first, **multi-agent distillation** to convert trajectories from specialized multi-agent systems into supervised fine-tuning data; second, **agentic reinforcement learning (RL)** to further improve on verifiable tasks. AFMs achieve state-of-the-art performance across web-agent and code-agent benchmarks (e.g., GAIA, WebWalker, BrowseComp, HLE), and the authors open-source all data, model weights, code, and training resources

    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces **NatureGAIA**, a new benchmark based on the principle of **Causal Pathways**, which decomposes complex GUI tasks into programmatically verifiable atomic steps for rigorous and reproducible evaluation. A hierarchical agent architecture (called **Agent**) was used to generate a human-verified trajectory dataset representing diverse and self-correcting interaction patterns. This dataset was used to conduct Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) on the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model. Even top-performing models like Claude-sonnet-4 only reached a Weighted Pathway Success Rate (WPSR) of 34.6 %, while RFT improved the smaller model from 3.3 % to 10.8 %, yet performance dropped significantly in complex scenarios—highlighting current limitations in GUI agent capabilities.

    - 📖 TLDR: Magentic-UI (Multi-agentic User Interface) is an open-source web interface enabling safe, efficient human–agent collaboration through a flexible multi-agent architecture. It supports web browsing, code execution, and file manipulation, and provides six interaction mechanisms—co-planning, co-tasking, multi-tasking, action guards, answer verification, and long-term memory—to integrate human oversight with AI autonomy. Evaluated via agentic benchmarks, simulated user tests, qualitative user study, and safety assessments, it demonstrates how incorporating human-in-the-loop dynamics can significantly improve agentic systems' reliability and performance.

    - 🔑 Key: [model], [framework], [grounding verifier], [attention mechanism], [coordinate‑free grounding], [GUI‑Actor]
    - 📖 TLDR: GUI‑Actor introduces a coordinate‑free visual grounding approach for GUI agents by adding an attention‑based “<ACTOR>” action head atop a frozen vision‑language model. It learns to align with relevant visual patches and produces multiple candidate regions per forward pass. An optional grounding verifier scores candidates to select the best. The method improves spatial‑semantic alignment and generalizes well across unseen resolutions. On benchmarks like ScreenSpot‑Pro, GUI‑Actor‑7B outperforms prior SOTA UI‑TARS‑72B, with verifier‑augmented versions achieving even higher accuracy—while only fine‑tuning ~100 M parameters.

    - 📖 TLDR: AgentCPM-GUI is an 8B-parameter on-device GUI agent tailored for Android applications, emphasizing robust multilingual interaction. Built upon MiniCPM-V, it undergoes a three-stage training pipeline: grounding-aware pre-training on a 12M-sample bilingual dataset, supervised fine-tuning with 55K high-quality trajectories from over 30 Chinese apps, and reinforcement fine-tuning using the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to enhance reasoning capabilities. The model introduces a compact JSON-based action space optimized for mobile efficiency. Evaluated across five benchmarks, including the newly introduced Chinese GUI benchmark CAGUI, AgentCPM-GUI achieves state-of-the-art performance, notably 96.9% Type-Match and 91.3% Exact-Match on CAGUI. All code, model checkpoints, and evaluation data are publicly released to support further research.

    - 🔑 Key: [benchmark], [safety], [VisualWebArena-Adv]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper investigates the safety risks posed by multimodal agents built on vision-enabled language models (VLMs). The authors introduce two adversarial attack methods: a captioner attack targeting white-box captioners and a CLIP attack that transfers to proprietary VLMs. To evaluate these attacks, they curated VisualWebArena-Adv, a set of adversarial tasks based on VisualWebArena. The study demonstrates that within a limited perturbation norm, the captioner attack can achieve a 75% success rate in making a captioner-augmented GPT-4V agent execute adversarial goals. The paper also discusses the robustness of agents based on other VLMs and provides insights into factors contributing to attack success and potential defenses.
