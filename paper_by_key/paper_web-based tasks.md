    - 📖 TLDR: AutoWebGLM introduces a web navigation agent based on ChatGLM3-6B, designed to autonomously navigate and interact with webpages for complex tasks. The paper highlights a two-phase data construction approach using a hybrid human-AI methodology for diverse, curriculum-based web task training. It also presents AutoWebBench, a benchmark for evaluating agent performance in web tasks, and uses reinforcement learning to fine-tune operations, addressing complex webpage interaction and grounding.

    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces *World of Bits (WoB)*, a platform enabling agents to perform complex web-based tasks using low-level keyboard and mouse actions, addressing the lack of open-domain realism in existing reinforcement learning environments. WoB leverages a novel framework where crowdworkers create tasks with structured rewards and reproducibility by caching web interactions, forming a stable training environment. The authors validate WoB by training agents via behavioral cloning and reinforcement learning to accomplish various real-world tasks, showcasing its potential as an effective platform for reinforcement learning on web tasks.
