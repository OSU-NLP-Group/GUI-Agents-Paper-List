    - 📖 TLDR: This survey introduces the concept of Generalist Virtual Agents (GVAs), autonomous entities designed to operate across various digital platforms and environments to assist users in performing diverse tasks. It traces the evolution of GVAs from early intelligent assistants to modern implementations incorporating large-scale models, discussing their philosophical foundations, development challenges, and current methodologies. The paper provides a detailed taxonomy of GVA environments, tasks, and capabilities, aiming to bridge theoretical and practical aspects and suggesting that agents operating in environments closely mirroring the real world are more likely to exhibit human-like intelligence.

    - 💻 Env: [GUI]
    - 🔑 Key: [survey]
    - 📖 TLDR: This survey consolidates recent research on GUI agents powered by foundation models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). It discusses representative datasets and benchmarks, summarizes a unified framework capturing essential components from prior studies, and explores commercial applications. The paper identifies key challenges and proposes future research directions to inspire further developments in (M)LLM-based GUI agents.
