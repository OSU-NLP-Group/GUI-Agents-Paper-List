    - 💻 Env: [GUI]
    - 🔑 Key: [dataset], [benchmark], [framework], [Jedi], [OSWorld‑G], [GUI grounding], [compositional generalization], [fine‑grained manipulation]
    - 📖 TLDR: This work tackles limitations in GUI grounding by introducing **OSWorld‑G**, a 564‑sample benchmark covering text matching, element recognition, layout understanding, fine‑grained manipulation, and refusal detection. They also synthesize **Jedi**, a massive 4 M‑example dataset generated via UI decomposition and synthesis. Training multi‑scale models on Jedi achieves state‑of‑the‑art grounding across benchmarks (ScreenSpot‑v2/Pro and OSWorld‑G), boosting agentic task performance from 5 % to ~27 % success. Ablations demonstrate compositional benefits. All artifacts are publicly released. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

    - 💻 Env: [Web]
    - 🔑 Key: [benchmark], [dataset], [GUI grounding], [speech input], [spatial reasoning], [temporal reasoning], [multi-step planning], [routine learning], [RealWebAssist]
    - 📖 TLDR: RealWebAssist introduces a benchmark for evaluating AI agents' ability to assist with long-horizon web tasks using sequential instructions from real-world users. The dataset includes 1,885 instructions across 107 tasks on 66 websites, featuring challenges like ambiguous instructions, GUI grounding, and evolving user goals. Evaluations show that current state-of-the-art models struggle with these complex, realistic scenarios.
