    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces *ScienceBoard*, a dynamic multimodal environment for evaluating autonomous agents in realistic scientific workflows. Built on an Ubuntu-based VM with integrated scientific software supporting both GUI and CLI interactions, the environment enables agents to operate like human researchers. Based on this infrastructure, ScienceBoard curates a benchmark of 169 human-validated tasks spanning six domains, including biochemistry, astronomy, GIS, and theorem proving. Evaluations of both general-purpose LLMs and GUI action models show that even state-of-the-art agents achieve only ~15% success, highlighting the substantial gap between current agent capabilities and real-world scientific demands.

    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces *RegionFocus*, a visual test-time scaling method for GUI agents that dynamically zooms into relevant regions within GUI images, reducing background clutter and enhancing grounding accuracy. By integrating an "image-as-map" mechanism to visualize key landmarks during each interaction step, the approach improves transparency and decision-making. Applied to state-of-the-art vision-language models like UI-TARS and Qwen2.5-VL, RegionFocus achieves significant performance gains—28% on ScreenSpot-Pro and 24% on WebVoyager benchmarks—setting a new state-of-the-art grounding accuracy of 61.6% on ScreenSpot-Pro.

    - 🔑 Key: [benchmark], [dataset], [framework], [UI-Vision], [UI-TARS-72B], [spatial reasoning], [drag-and-drop], [element grounding], [layout grounding], [action prediction]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces *UI-Vision*, a comprehensive, license-permissive benchmark designed for evaluating autonomous agents in real-world desktop GUI environments. It encompasses 83 software applications with dense annotations of human demonstrations, including bounding boxes, UI labels, and action trajectories. The benchmark defines three tasks—Element Grounding, Layout Grounding, and Action Prediction—to assess agents' performance. Evaluations reveal limitations in state-of-the-art models like UI-TARS-72B, particularly in understanding professional software, spatial reasoning, and complex actions such as drag-and-drop. By releasing UI-Vision as open-source, the authors aim to advance the development of more capable agents for desktop tasks.

    - 💻 Env: [GUI]
    - 🔑 Key: [model], [UI-TARS]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces **UI-TARS**, a native GUI agent model that processes screenshots to perform human-like interactions such as keyboard and mouse operations. Unlike traditional frameworks relying on commercial models with handcrafted prompts, UI-TARS is an end-to-end model demonstrating superior performance across over 10 GUI agent benchmarks. Key innovations include enhanced perception through large-scale GUI screenshot datasets, unified action modeling across platforms, incorporation of deliberate multi-step reasoning (System-2 Reasoning), and iterative training with reflective online traces, enabling continuous learning and adaptation with minimal human intervention.
