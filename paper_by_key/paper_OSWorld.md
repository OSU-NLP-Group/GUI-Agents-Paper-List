    - Pei Yang, Hai Ci, and Mike Zheng Shou
    - 🏛️ Institutions: NUS
    - 📅 Date: June 4, 2025
    - 📑 Publisher: arXiv
    - 💻 Env: [desktop]
    - 🔑 Key: [benchmark], [multilingual], [safety], [macOSWorld]
    - 📖 TLDR: Introduces **macOSWorld**, the first interactive benchmark for GUI agents on macOS, with 202 tasks across 30 apps (28 macOS-exclusive) in 5 languages plus a safety subset for deception attacks; evaluates 6 agents, showing proprietary CUAs outperform open-source and VLM-based agents, significant language gaps (Arabic –27.5%), and both grounding and safety challenges :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

- [UI-Evol: Automatic Knowledge Evolving for Computer Use Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21964)
    - Ziyun Zhang, Xinyi Liu, Xiaoyi Zhang, Jun Wang, Gang Chen, Yan Lu
    - 🏛️ Institutions: Peking University, Microsoft Research Asia
    - 📅 Date: May 28, 2025

    - 💻 Env: [desktop]
    - 🔑 Key: [framework], [knowledge-execution gap], [Critique Stage], [Retrace Stage], [OSWorld], [self‑evolution]
    - 📖 TLDR: The paper identifies a “knowledge‑execution gap” where even highly accurate external knowledge (90%) only yields a 41% execution success rate. To bridge this, the authors introduce **UI‑Evol**, a plug‑and‑play two‑stage module for GUI agents—**Retrace** recovers actual action sequences from real agent–environment interactions, and **Critique** refines knowledge by comparing these sequences with external references. Experiments using Agent S2 on the OSWorld benchmark show significant gains in task performance and reduced behavioral variance, improving agent reliability. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

- [Agent S2: A Compositional Generalist-Specialist Framework for Computer Use Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00906)
    - Saaket Agashe, Kyle Wong, Vincent Tu, Jiachen Yang, Ang Li, Xin Eric Wang
    - 🏛️ Institutions: Simular Research

    - 📑 Publisher: arXiv
    - 💻 Env: [GUI]
    - 🔑 Key: [framework], [Mixture-of-Grounding], [Proactive Hierarchical Planning], [benchmark], [OSWorld], [WindowsAgentArena], [AndroidWorld]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces *Agent S2*, a compositional framework for computer use agents that combines generalist and specialist models to address challenges in GUI element grounding and long-horizon task planning. The framework employs a novel Mixture-of-Grounding technique for precise GUI localization and Proactive Hierarchical Planning to dynamically refine action plans. Evaluations demonstrate that Agent S2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like OSWorld, WindowsAgentArena, and AndroidWorld, outperforming existing agents such as Claude Computer Use and UI-TARS.

    - 🏛️ Institutions: Rutgers University, AIOS Foundation
    - 📅 Date: May 24, 2025 (submitted to arXiv on May 24, 2025) :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
    - 📑 Publisher: arXiv
    - 💻 Env: [Desktop]
    - 🔑 Key: [framework], [benchmark], [model context protocol], [MCP], [OSWorld], [LiteCUA]
    - 📖 TLDR: Introduces AIOS 1.0, which contextualizes desktop computer states via an MCP server so LLM-powered agents can better understand and operate GUIs. Built on top, LiteCUA—a lightweight agent—achieves 14.66 % success on the OSWorld benchmark, outperforming several heavier agent frameworks, showing the benefits of environment contextualization. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
