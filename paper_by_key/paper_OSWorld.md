    - 💻 Env: [Desktop]
    - 🔑 Key: [framework], [hybrid agent], [coding action], [multi-agent system], [OSWorld]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces **CoAct‑1**, a multi-agent system where an Orchestrator coordinates between a GUI Operator and a Programmer agent that can execute code (Python/Bash) directly. This hybrid design allows the agent to perform complex desktop tasks more efficiently than GUI-only agents. Evaluated on the OSWorld benchmark, CoAct‑1 achieves high task success and efficiency.

- [macOSWorld: A Multilingual Interactive Benchmark for GUI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04135)
    - Pei Yang, Hai Ci, and Mike Zheng Shou
    - 🏛️ Institutions: NUS
    - 📅 Date: June 4, 2025
    - 📑 Publisher: arXiv
    - 💻 Env: [desktop]
    - 🔑 Key: [benchmark], [multilingual], [safety], [macOSWorld]
    - 📖 TLDR: Introduces **macOSWorld**, the first interactive benchmark for GUI agents on macOS, with 202 tasks across 30 apps (28 macOS-exclusive) in 5 languages plus a safety subset for deception attacks; evaluates 6 agents, showing proprietary CUAs outperform open-source and VLM-based agents, significant language gaps (Arabic –27.5%), and both grounding and safety challenges.

- [UI-Evol: Automatic Knowledge Evolving for Computer Use Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21964)

    - 💻 Env: [desktop]
    - 🔑 Key: [framework], [knowledge-execution gap], [Critique Stage], [Retrace Stage], [OSWorld], [self‑evolution]
    - 📖 TLDR: The paper identifies a “knowledge‑execution gap” where even highly accurate external knowledge (90%) only yields a 41% execution success rate. To bridge this, the authors introduce **UI‑Evol**, a plug‑and‑play two‑stage module for GUI agents—**Retrace** recovers actual action sequences from real agent–environment interactions, and **Critique** refines knowledge by comparing these sequences with external references. Experiments using Agent S2 on the OSWorld benchmark show significant gains in task performance and reduced behavioral variance, improving agent reliability.

    - 💻 Env: [GUI]
    - 🔑 Key: [dataset], [benchmark], [framework], [Jedi], [OSWorld‑G], [GUI grounding], [compositional generalization], [fine‑grained manipulation]
    - 📖 TLDR: This work tackles limitations in GUI grounding by introducing **OSWorld‑G**, a 564‑sample benchmark covering text matching, element recognition, layout understanding, fine‑grained manipulation, and refusal detection. They also synthesize **Jedi**, a massive 4 M‑example dataset generated via UI decomposition and synthesis. Training multi‑scale models on Jedi achieves state‑of‑the‑art grounding across benchmarks (ScreenSpot‑v2/Pro and OSWorld‑G), boosting agentic task performance from 5 % to ~27 % success. Ablations demonstrate compositional benefits. All artifacts are publicly released.

- [Agent S2: A Compositional Generalist-Specialist Framework for Computer Use Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00906)

    - 💻 Env: [GUI]
    - 🔑 Key: [framework], [Mixture-of-Grounding], [Proactive Hierarchical Planning], [benchmark], [OSWorld], [WindowsAgentArena], [AndroidWorld]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces *Agent S2*, a compositional framework for computer use agents that combines generalist and specialist models to address challenges in GUI element grounding and long-horizon task planning. The framework employs a novel Mixture-of-Grounding technique for precise GUI localization and Proactive Hierarchical Planning to dynamically refine action plans. Evaluations demonstrate that Agent S2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like OSWorld, WindowsAgentArena, and AndroidWorld, outperforming existing agents such as Claude Computer Use and UI-TARS.
