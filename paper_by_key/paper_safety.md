    - 📖 TLDR: Magentic-UI (Multi-agentic User Interface) is an open-source web interface enabling safe, efficient human–agent collaboration through a flexible multi-agent architecture. It supports web browsing, code execution, and file manipulation, and provides six interaction mechanisms—co-planning, co-tasking, multi-tasking, action guards, answer verification, and long-term memory—to integrate human oversight with AI autonomy. Evaluated via agentic benchmarks, simulated user tests, qualitative user study, and safety assessments, it demonstrates how incorporating human-in-the-loop dynamics can significantly improve agentic systems' reliability and performance.

    - 💻 Env: [Web]
    - 🔑 Key: [dataset], [safety]
    - 📖 TLDR:  Autonomous web agents powered by LLMs can take unintended or harmful actions when interacting with websites (especially state-changing ones). WebGuard is introduced as a dataset to assess risks of web agent actions by collecting nearly 5,000 human‑annotated actions across many real websites, labeled by risk level (SAFE / LOW / HIGH). Baseline LLMs do poorly (<60% accuracy / recall) on detecting high‑risk actions; after fine‑tuning (using Qwen2.5VL‑7B), performance improves significantly (accuracy ~80%, recall on HIGH ~76%), though still not sufficient for very high‑stakes settings. The paper highlights that reliable guardrails for web agents remain an open challenge. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

    - 🏛️ Institutions: Georgia Tech, HKU, Stanford
    - 📅 Date: Nov 4, 2024
    - 📑 Publisher: arXiv
    - 💻 Env: [GUI]
    - 🔑 Key: [attack], [adversarial pop-ups], [VLM agents], [safety]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper demonstrates that vision-language model (VLM) agents can be easily deceived by carefully designed adversarial pop-ups, leading them to perform unintended actions such as clicking on these pop-ups instead of completing their assigned tasks. Integrating these pop-ups into environments like OSWorld and VisualWebArena resulted in an average attack success rate of 86% and a 47% decrease in task success rate. Basic defense strategies, such as instructing the agent to ignore pop-ups or adding advertisement notices, were found to be ineffective against these attacks.

    - 💻 Env: [Web]
    - 🔑 Key: [benchmark], [safety], [VisualWebArena-Adv]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper investigates the safety risks posed by multimodal agents built on vision-enabled language models (VLMs). The authors introduce two adversarial attack methods: a captioner attack targeting white-box captioners and a CLIP attack that transfers to proprietary VLMs. To evaluate these attacks, they curated VisualWebArena-Adv, a set of adversarial tasks based on VisualWebArena. The study demonstrates that within a limited perturbation norm, the captioner attack can achieve a 75% success rate in making a captioner-augmented GPT-4V agent execute adversarial goals. The paper also discusses the robustness of agents based on other VLMs and provides insights into factors contributing to attack success and potential defenses.
