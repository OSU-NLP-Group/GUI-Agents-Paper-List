This dataset was used to conduct Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) on the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model. Even top-performing models like Claude-sonnet-4 only reached a Weighted Pathway Success Rate (WPSR) of 34.6%, while RFT improved the smaller model from 3.3% to 10.8%, yet performance dropped significantly in complex scenarios, highlighting current limitations in GUI agent capabilities.

    - 📖 TLDR: This study presents a reinforcement learning-based approach to train agents for computer control tasks, using keyboard and mouse interactions guided by natural language. By leveraging human demonstration data, agents trained in this environment achieved strong cross-task generalization across the MiniWob++ benchmark. This framework demonstrates how agents can control computers as humans would, enabling enhanced performance in complex computer tasks with high transferability.

    - 📖 TLDR: AndroidEnv provides a reinforcement learning (RL) platform for Android that lets RL agents interact with a realistic Android simulation via touchscreen events. The platform supports diverse applications, enabling agents to interact with over 100 predefined tasks across a variety of apps. With hybrid continuous and discrete action spaces, AndroidEnv is well-suited for training agents in complex, real-world Android scenarios where actions must be contextually sequenced, such as in UI navigation, gaming, and productivity apps. This environment encourages further RL research by offering task flexibility and realistic Android emulation.

    - 📖 TLDR: This paper presents a novel RL approach using *workflow-guided exploration* to efficiently train agents on web-based tasks, where actions are restricted based on demonstrated workflows to streamline learning. Evaluated on MiniWoB and MiniWoB++ benchmarks, the method significantly outperforms traditional RL techniques in sparse reward settings by structuring exploration according to high-level action constraints.

    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces *World of Bits (WoB)*, a platform enabling agents to perform complex web-based tasks using low-level keyboard and mouse actions, addressing the lack of open-domain realism in existing reinforcement learning environments. WoB leverages a novel framework where crowdworkers create tasks with structured rewards and reproducibility by caching web interactions, forming a stable training environment. The authors validate WoB by training agents via behavioral cloning and reinforcement learning to accomplish various real-world tasks, showcasing its potential as an effective platform for reinforcement learning on web tasks.
