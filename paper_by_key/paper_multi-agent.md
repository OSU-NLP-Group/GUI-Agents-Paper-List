    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces IntentCUA, a multi-agent computer-use framework for stabilizing long-horizon desktop automation through intent-aligned plan memory. It learns intent-level representations from interaction traces, abstracts reusable skills, and coordinates a Planner, Plan-Optimizer, and Critic over shared memory to reduce redundant replanning and error accumulation. On end-to-end evaluations over desktop applications, IntentCUA outperforms RL-based and trajectory-centric baselines, highlighting intent abstraction and memory-grounded multi-agent planning as an effective systems design for computer-use agents.
