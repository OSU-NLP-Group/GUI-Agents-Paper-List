    - 📖 TLDR: This paper presents *UIBert*, a multimodal model aimed at understanding user interfaces (UIs) by combining visual, textual, and structural metadata. UIBert is designed for tasks such as component retrieval and expression resolution, using a transformer-based joint image-text model. The authors introduce five novel pre-training tasks to leverage UI-specific features, enhancing accessibility and task completion in mobile applications. UIBert demonstrates superior performance on nine downstream UI tasks, highlighting the potential of multimodal pre-training in UI understanding.

    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces the task of *widget captioning*, which aims to automatically generate natural language descriptions for UI elements in mobile apps to enhance accessibility. Using both visual and structural data from UI components, the study presents a novel dataset of 162,859 captions across 61,285 UI elements. Multiple deep learning models were tested on this dataset, with findings suggesting the potential for improving screen reader usability for visually impaired users by generating descriptive captions of UI elements.
