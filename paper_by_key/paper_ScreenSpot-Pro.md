    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces **UI-R1**, a framework that enhances the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for GUI action prediction tasks through rule-based reinforcement learning. Utilizing a small, high-quality dataset of 136 challenging mobile tasks, the authors design a unified rule-based action reward function and optimize the model using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). The resulting model, **UI-R1-3B**, demonstrates significant improvements over the base model (Qwen2.5-VL-3B) on both in-domain (AndroidControl) and out-of-domain (ScreenSpot-Pro) benchmarks, showcasing the effectiveness of rule-based RL in advancing GUI understanding and control.

    - 💻 Env: [GUI]
    - 🔑 Key: [framework], [dataset], [benchmark], [dual-system cognition], [FOCUS], [ScreenSpot], [ScreenSpot-Pro]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces **FOCUS**, a novel GUI grounding framework inspired by human dual-system cognition. FOCUS dynamically switches between a fast, intuitive system and a slow, analytical system based on task complexity. The framework decomposes GUI grounding into three stages: interface summarization, focused analysis, and precise coordinate prediction. Trained on a synthesized dataset of 300,000 samples, FOCUS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ScreenSpot and ScreenSpot-Pro benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements in both efficiency and accuracy for complex GUI interactions.
