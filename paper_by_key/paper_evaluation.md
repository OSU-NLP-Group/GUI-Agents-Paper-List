    - 🔑 Key: [benchmark], [dataset], [framework], [long-horizon reasoning], [unknown-tools challenge], [execution-based evaluation], [MCP-Universe]
    - 📖 TLDR: MCP-Universe introduces the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) through interactions with real-world Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. It spans six core domains—Location Navigation, Repository Management, Financial Analysis, 3D Design, Browser Automation, and Web Searching—across 11 MCP servers. The benchmark employs execution-based evaluators (format, static, dynamic) to rigorously assess agent performance. Despite progress, state-of-the-art models like GPT-5 (43.72% success), Grok-4 (33.33%), and Claude-4.0-Sonnet (29.44%) show significant limitations. The benchmark highlights challenges in long-context reasoning and unfamiliar tool handling, and provides an open-source extensible evaluation framework with UI support to accelerate future research.
