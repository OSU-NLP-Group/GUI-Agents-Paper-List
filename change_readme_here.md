## How to Add a Paper

TODO: Move the details to the bottom later. Also add a ToC.

### format example:

```
- [title](paper link)
    - List authors directly without a "key" identifier (e.g., author1, author2)
    - 🏛️ Institutions: List the institutions concisely, using abbreviations (e.g., university names, like OSU).
    - 📅 Date: e.g., Oct 30, 2024
    - 📑 Publisher: ICLR 2025
    - 💻 Env: Indicate the research environment within brackets, such as [Web], [Mobile], or [Desktop]. Use [GUI] if the research spans multiple environments. Use [General] if it is researching on general domains.
    - 🔑 Key: Label each keyword within brackets, e.g., [model], [framework],[dataset],[benchmark].
    - 📖 TLDR: Brief summary of the paper.
```

Regarding the 🔑 Key: 
- model: Indicates a newly trained model.
- framework: If the paper proposes a new framework. 
- dataset: If a new dataset is created and published. 
- benchmark: If a new benchmark is established (add "dataset" if there's a new training set).
- primary Innovation: List the main focus or innovation in the study. 
- Common Abbreviations: Include commonly used abbreviations associated with the paper. (model names, framework names, etc.)

For missing information, use "Unknown."

You can contribute by providing either the paper title or a fully formatted entry in [Paper Collection](https://github.com/boyugou/GUI-Agents-Paper-List/issues/1). You’re also welcome to open a new PR with your submission.

## TODO: Add subgroups here (benchmark, datasets, models, learning, safety, framework, etc.
